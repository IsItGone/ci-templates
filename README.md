# CI Templates

This repository offers reusable GitHub Actions composite actions for use across multiple repositories.

## üì¶ Features

- Standardized composite actions for building, testing, and for Docker image build & push.
- Supports Gradle-based JAR builds and Docker image build & push using Docker Buildx.

## üöÄ Usage

To integrate the composite actions defined in this repository into your workflow, reference them in your workflow file. It is recommended to use the main ref (e.g., @main) to always obtain the latest version of the actions.

For instance, to perform a Gradle JAR build, use like:  
```yaml
uses: IsItGone/ci-templates@main/.github/actions/build-jar
```

For Docker image build and push, use like:  
```yaml
uses: IsItGone/ci-templates@main/.github/actions/build-and-push-image  
with:  
  tag: 1.0.0  
  image-name: owner/image  
  password: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_PASSWORD }}  
  # Optional inputs:  
  # dockerfile: "./Dockerfile"  
  # registry: "ghcr.io"  
  # username: "ddd-cute-bot"
```
